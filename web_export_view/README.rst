Export Current View
===================

One of the best OpenERP's features is exporting custom data to CSV/XLS. You can
do it by clicking on the export link in the sidebar. The export action allows
us to configure what to be exported by selecting fields, etc, and allows you
to save your export as a template so that you can export it once again without
having to configure it again.

That feature is as great and advanced as limited for an everyday experience.
A lot of customers want simply to export the tree view they are looking to.

If you miss this feature as us, probably you'll find an answer into our
web_export_view module.


Usage
=====

After you installed it, you'll find an additional link 'Export current view'
right below the 'Export' one. By clicking on it you'll get a XLS file contains
the same data of the tree view you are looking at, headers included.
